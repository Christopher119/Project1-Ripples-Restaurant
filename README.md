## Ripples Restaurant

---

This website is for the Kerrykeel based restaurant called Ripple's Restaurant. Currently they only operate a Facebook and Instagram page. This site is targeted towards the owner of the business as a means to better promote themselves and to potential customers looking to learn more about the restauarant, what food and services they have on offer (such as perusing their menu) and how to contact and book with them.

## Strategy


## Scope

    Users
        Users want to be able to find clear and concise information about the restaurant
        Users want to be able to view a menu for the food available
        Users want to be able to view prices
        Users want to be able to book a reservation
        Users want to be able to find and contact the restaurant for bigger occasions
        Users want to be able to order food online

    Owners
        The owners will want to show the best their restaurant has to offer
        The owners will want to advertise their appealing location and scenic views
        The owners will want to show off the quality and presentation of their food
        The owners will want to attract more users
        The owners will want the promotion from good reviews

## Structure

    The structure to achieve the above scope should include at least 3 pages for simplicity's sake.
    A home page, giving a brief overview of the restuarant.
    A menu page for users to see what can be ordered.
    A booking page for users to reserve tables or events.
    Each page should be clear and concise.

    Home page  
        The home page should be a simple welcome page.
        It should include a brief introduction about the restaurant and it's services.
        It should include a blurb about the type of food on their menu.
        It should allow for easy navigation to the other pages on the site.


    Menu page
        The menu page should be clean and have a simple flow of information.
        Lunch menu options followed by Dinner menu split into the three main courses.
        The menu page should have some pictures to showcase the food to draw in the users.

    Booking page
        The booking page should consist of a simple form with the relevant information for booking.
        The form should include a Users name, contact info, time and date of reservation, and number of guests.
        The page should include contact information for booking the restaurant more fully for bigger events.
        The page should include an iframe map to show users the exact location of the restaurant.

    Each page should have a nav bar allowing users to easily navigate between pages.
    Each page should include a footer with the restaurant address and social media links.

## Features

## Navigation Bar
    The Nav Bar
        The navigation bar works as one would expect of any website. Positioned at the top of the page it allows users to quickly jump from each of the three pages, and clearly displays which page a user is currently on.

## Main Pages

    The Home  page
        The home page includes a simple title and tagline, a section to give users a quick intro to the restaurant and the services it provides, and a section to quicly describe the type of food served. Both of the latter sections include a button to quickly navigate to the corresponding page.

    The Menu page
        The menu page gives the users an example of the food that is available at Ripple's Restaurant.
        Most users who go to a site for a restaurant will want some idea of what is served there so I felt it vitally important to detail the various options on offer.
        Each section is clearly detailed by course as well as any additional options.

    Booking page
        This section will allow the user to use a form to book a reservation at the restaurant. It includes simple fields for names, number of people, times and dates, as well as email and phone numbers.
        For more complex bookings there is also the restaurants contact info included for users to reach out.
        In addition I have also included a iframe using the Google Maps API to show users the exact location of the restaurant.


    The Footer
        The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Love Running. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
        The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media

## Footer

    Footer
        The footer quite simply contains the restaurants address, as well as icon links to the restaurants Facebook and Instagram profiles.
        The footer remains at the bottom of each page and is consistent across all three.


## Features Left to Implement

    The option to include a cart functionality for takeaway orders would be nice to include in the future.
    This would require an overhaul of the menu page to include prices and allow for more interactivity on the page to add specific items to a cart.
    In addition a cart page itself would also need to be included for the user to check their order before going through an order process.

    A reviews page is also a possible addition, allowing users of the site to quickly and easily see how well the restaurant performs and how nice their food is before committing to booking.

## Testing

The website was built for mobile platforms first and was tested to ensure all pages and sections within worked as expected.
Afterwards the site was tested for landscape phones, tablet screens, laptops, and desktops to understand how the site reacted and performed to shifting screen sizes.

## Validator Testing

    HTML
        I have yet to validate the code as I am still in the process of perfecting the pages.
    CSS
        I have yet to validate the code as I am still in the process of perfecting the pages.

## Unfixed Bugs

    Currently the pages do not properly fill the viewport height of the screen effectively, and attempts to make them do so break the flow of information presented.
    Css Issues with regards to flexbox's row functionality for the "Menu" page depending on viewport width.

## Deployment

The site has been deployed to GitHub pages.

    The icons for the burger menu of the header and the socials links in the footer were taken from Font Awesome

    The method used for the mobile focused header/nav bar was adapted from the Love Running project.

    Using inline:block for buttons to adapt their height was found online:

    Shifting the mouse cursor into a pointer finger was learned simply by inspecting websites that had that functionality:
        "cursor: pointer;"
